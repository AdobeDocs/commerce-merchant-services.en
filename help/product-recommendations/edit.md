# Edit Recommendation

The Edit Recommendation page gives you the ability to adjust the individual settings that make up the recommendation. All settings can be edited except the page type and recommendation type. The following settings can be edited:

- [Recommendation name](#name)
- [Storefront label](#label)
- [Number of products](#number)
- [Placement and Position](#placement)
- [Filter products](#filters)

The preview on the right side of the page shows how the recommendation with the current settings might appear in the storefront. The _Recommended products preview_ remains visible for reference as you scroll down the page. The preview displays a thumbnail product image, the product name, SKU, price, and result type for each product returned. The result type indicates if there is enough primary behavioral data to generate the recommendation, or if it is using backup behavioral data.

Any changes made to product [filters](filters.md) are reflected in the _Recommended products preview_. Only products that match inclusion filters are allowed to be recommended. Products that match any exclusion filters are not recommended.

The _Inclusions_ and _Exclusions_ tabs list the available filters of each type. In the list, each active filter is marked with a blue dot.
