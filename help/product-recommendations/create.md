# Create New Recommendation

When you create a recommendation, you create a _recommendation unit_ that contains the recommended product _items_.

![Recommendation unit](assets/unit.png)

When you activate the recommendation unit, Adobe Commerce starts to [collect data](workspace.md) to measure impressions, views, clicks, and so on. The [!DNL Product Recommendations] table displays the metrics for each recommendation unit to help you make informed business decisions.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Promotions_ > **Product Recommendations** to display the _Product Recommendations_ workspace.

1. Specify the [Store View](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/setup/websites-stores-views.html#scope-settings) where you want the recommendations to display.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > Page Builder recommendation units must be created in the default store view, but then can be used anywhere. To learn more about creating product recommendations with Page Builder, see [Add Content - Product Recommendations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/page-builder/add-content/recommendations.html).

1. Click **Create Recommendation**.

1. In the _Name your Recommendation_ section, enter a descriptive name for internal reference, such as `Home page most popular`.

1. In the _Select page type_ section, select the page where you want the recommendation to appear from the following options:

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   > Product Recommendations are not supported on the Cart page when your store is configured to [display the shopping cart page immediately after adding a product to the cart](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/point-of-purchase/cart/cart-configuration.html#redirect-to-cart).

   * Home Page
   * Category
   * Product Detail
   * Cart
   * Confirmation
   * [Page Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/page-builder/add-content/recommendations.html)

   You can create up to five active recommendation units for each page type, and up to 25 for Page Builder. The page type is grayed out When the limit is reached.

   ![Recommendation name and page](assets/create-recommendation.png)
   _Recommendation name and page placement_

1. In the _Select Recommendation type_ section, specify the [type of recommendation](type.md) you want to appear on the selected page. For some pages, the [placement](placement.md) of recommendations is limited to certain types.

1. In the _Storefront display label_ section, enter the [label](placement.md#recommendation-labels) that is visible to your shoppers, such as "Top sellers".

1. In the _Choose number of products_ section, use the slider to specify how many products you want to appear in the recommendation unit.

   The default is `5`, with a maximum of `20`.

1. In the _Select placement_ section, specify the location where the recommendation unit is to appear on the page.

   * At the bottom of main content
   * At the top of main content

1. (Optional) To change the order of the recommendations, select, and move the rows in the _Choose position_ table.

   The _Choose position_ section displays all recommendations (if any) created for the page type you selected.

1. (Optional) In the _Filters_ section, [apply filters](filters.md) to control which products appear in the recommendation unit.

   ![Recommendation filters](assets/create-recommendation-filter-products.png)
   _Recommendation product filters_

1. When complete, click one of the following:

   * **Save as draft** to edit the recommendation unit later. You cannot modify the page type or recommendation type for a recommendation unit in a draft state.

   * **Activate** to enable the recommendation unit on your storefront.

## Readiness indicators

Some recommendation types use behavioral data from your shoppers to [train machine learning models](behavioral-data.md) to build personalized recommendations. 

Requires only catalog data. No behavioral data is needed for these:

* _Most Like This_
* _Recently Viewed_
* _Visual Similarity_

Based on last six months of storefront behavioral data:

* _Viewed this, viewed that_
* _Viewed this, bought that_
* _Bought this, bought that_
* _Recommended for you_

Popularity-based recommendation types use the last seven days of storefront behavioral data:

* Most Viewed
* Most Purchased
* Added to Cart
* Trending

Readiness indicator values are expected to fluctuate due to factors such as the overall size of the catalog, volume of product interaction events (views, adds to cart, purchases), and percentage of skus that register those events within a certain time window, as listed above. For example, during peak holiday season traffic, the readiness indicators might show higher values than in times of normal volume.

To help you visualize the training progress of each recommendation type, the _Select Recommendation type_ section displays a measure of readiness for each type. These readiness indicators are calculated based on a couple factors:

* Sufficient result set size: Are there enough results being returned in most scenarios to avoid using [backup recommendations](behavioral-data.md#backuprecs)? 

* Sufficient result set variety: Do the products being returned represent a variety of products from your catalog? The goal with this factor is to avoid having a minority of products being the only items recommended across the site. 

Based on the above factors, a readiness value is calculated and displayed. A recommendation type is considered ready to deploy when its readiness value is 75% or higher. A recommendation type is considered partially ready when its readiness is at least 50%. A recommendation type is considered not ready to deploy when its readiness value is less than 50%. These are general guidelines but each individual case can differ based on the nature of collected data as outlined above.

FROM THE WIKI

What do they mean?
------------------

The readiness indicators are a percentage of products that have the statistics or rfIndicators field in their Elastic Search document for the given recommendation type. It is a simple calculation that may indicate how many products might be recommended depending on the recommendation type. The products get statistics based on the volume of interactions (views, clicks, add-to-carts), that means if some products are never interacted with it's possible for them to never be recommended depending on the recommendation type.

What do customers/support think they mean? (Based on communication/feedback received in Jira tickets)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The readiness indicators are an indication of how much the model is trained and independent of types of events collected, the breadth of products interacted with and size of catalog. From the tickets received in Jira there is a misunderstanding of how the readiness indicators are calculated and how they should approach 100%.

There is a misunderstanding of how the readiness indicators are being calculated. Before the migration to URIS, we didn't clear old statistics/rfIndicators data so the readiness indicators would steadily increase if products eventually got some data. Since the recommendations types are re-calculated over a sliding window, the readiness indicators can fluctuate up and down which can cause confusion around what readiness means. It can be confusing if recommendation types come in and out of being "Ready".

The customers don't have any real feedback as to why the readiness indicators fluctuate which causes confusion and this is why we get lots of support cases.

### Current Documentation

Documentation is clear but has no guidance on what to do if they are low.

  

### Static Indicators

Indicators that depend on the customer's catalog only.Â 

* More Like This
* Recently Viewed
* Visual Similarity

Low percentages for these indicators may be caused by missing catalog data for the displayable products.

If they are lower than expected a full sync may fix this issue. This has worked in the past for Visual Similarity as the images had to go through processing again.

### Dynamic Indicators

Based on last six months of storefront behavioral data:

* Viewed this, viewed that
* Viewed this, bought that
* Bought this, bought that
* Recommended for you

Popularity-based recommendation types use the last seven days of storefront behavioral data:

* Most Viewed
* Most Purchased
* Added to Cart
* Trending

Low percentages for these indicators may be caused by

1. Missing fields in the required events for the respective recommendations (correct requestId, product context etc.)
1. Low traffic = low event volume, therefore cannot formulate recommendation data
1. The variety of events across different products in your store is low.


WIKI COMMENTS

A useful first step might be to call out the difference between static and dynamic indicators :

Static will remain the same as long the catalog is synced and there are displayable products with catalog data populated. 
Dynamic indicators will vary depending on the shopper activity across products


Understanding a low percentage of readiness indicators:

Static - Not all products in your catalog that are displayable have the correct catalog data populated
Dynamic - This could point to two things
Your events are not coming through with the correct context(correct requestId, product context etc)
Your store does not have a lot of traffic so the events volume is low
The variety of events across different products in your store is low. Eg: if only 10% of your products are viewed/bought most of the time then the respective readiness indicators will be low. This does not mean that there's a problem with training the recommendations model. (internal note - just a tip, they could run a campaign to increase variety across more skus)

Krithika Chandran
Erik Marr Adding this additional note from our Slack conversation:

I want to change the wording to clarify two things:

These are indicators that show which rec types will perform best based on the catalog and behavioral data we have right now
A low readiness % indicates that there are not a lot of products from their catalog that would be included in recommendations for this rec type. This means there's a chance backup recs will be returned if they deployed this rec type anyway.
  

### Next Steps

Doc updates explaining what to do when the indicators are low. There should be a level of understanding between support and the customer so that any and all issues do not results in tickets.

The readiness indicators do provide value if they are understood correctly. They should be a simple way for the customers to understand whether or not a recommendation type should be used given their shopping data. They can also be used to determine if they have issues with their eventing or if they do not have enough traffic to populate the recommendation type. We should link to other docs to make sure they have eventing set up correctly and to make sure customers/support know what they are looking at if issues do come up.


















## Preview Recommendations {#preview}

The _Recommended products preview_ panel is always available with a sample selection of products that might appear in the recommendation unit when it is deployed to the storefront.

To test a recommendation when working in a non-production environment, you can fetch recommendation data from a [different source](settings.md). This allows merchants to experiment with rules and preview the recommendations before deploying to production.

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|Name|The name of the product.|
|SKU|The Stock Keeping Unit assigned to the product|
|Price|The price of the product.|
|Result Type|Primary - indicates that there is enough training data collected to display a recommendation.<br />Backup - indicates that there is not enough training data collected so a backup recommendation is used to fill the slot. Go to [Behavioral Data](behavioral-data.md) to learn more about machine learning models and backup recommendations.|

As you create your recommendation unit, experiment with the page type, recommendation type, and filters to get immediate real-time feedback about the products that will be included. As you begin to understand which products appear, you can configure the recommendation unit to meet your business needs.

Adobe Commerce [filters](filters.md) recommendations to avoid displaying duplicate products when multiple recommendation units are deployed on a single page. As a result, the products that appear in the preview panel might differ from those that appear in the storefront.
