# Install [!DNL Data Connection]

Before you install the extension, [review the prerequisites](overview.md#prereqs).

## Install the extension

The [!DNL Data Connection] extension is available from the [Adobe Marketplace](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/magento-experience-platform-connector.html). When you install this extension from the command line of the server, it connects to your Adobe Commerce installation as a [service](../landing/saas.md). When the process is complete, **[!DNL Data Connection]** and **Commerce Services Connector** appear on the **System** menu under **Services** in the Commerce _Admin_.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>While the name of the extension has changed from Experience Platform connector to [!DNL Data Connection], the package name remains `experience-platform-connector` to support backward compatibility.

1. To download the `experience-platform-connector` package, run the following from the command line:

   ```bash
   composer require magento/experience-platform-connector
   ```

   This metapackage contains the following modules and extensions:

   - `magento/orders-connector`
   - `magento/data-services`
   - `magento/module-experience-connector`
   - `magento/module-experience-connector-admin`
   - `magento/module-experience-connector-admin-graph-ql`
   - `magento/module-experience-connector-aep-integration`

1. (Optional) To include [!DNL Live Search] data, which comprises [search events](events.md#search-events), install the [[!DNL Live Search]](../live-search/install.md) extension.

1. (Optional) To include B2B data, which comprises [requisition events](events.md#b2b-events), install the [B2B extension](#install-the-b2b-extension).

### Install the Adobe I/O Events

After you install the `experience-platform-connector` extension, you must install the Adobe I/O Events for Adobe Commerce and configure the `magento/customers-connector` extension.

The following steps apply to both Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure and on-premises installations.

1. If you are running Commerce 2.4.4 or 2.4.5, use the following command to load the eventing modules:

   ```bash
   composer require magento/commerce-eventing=^1.0 --no-update
   ```

   Commerce 2.4.6 and later loads these modules automatically.

1. Update the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   composer update
   ```

1. Enable the new modules:

   ```bash
   bin/magento module:enable Magento_AdobeCommerceEventsClient Magento_AdobeCommerceEventsGenerator Magento_AdobeIoEventsClient Magento_AdobeCommerceOutOfProcessExtensibility
   ```

Finalize installation based on the deployment type: on-premises or Adobe Commerce on Cloud infrastructure.

#### On-premises

In on-premises environments, you must manually enable code generation and Adobe Commerce Events:

   ```bash
   bin/magento events:generate:module
   bin/magento module:enable Magento_AdobeCommerceEvents
   bin/magento setup:upgrade
   bin/magento setup:di:compile
   bin/magento config:set adobe_io_events/eventing/enabled 1
   ```

#### On Cloud infrastructure

In Adobe Commerce on Cloud infrastructure, enable the `ENABLE_EVENTING` global variable in `.magento.env.yaml`. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/env/stage/variables-global.html#enable_eventing).

   ```bash
   stage:
      global:
         ENABLE_EVENTING: true
   ```

Commit and push updated files to the Cloud environment. When deployment is finished, enable sending events with the following command:

   ```bash
   bin/magento config:set adobe_io_events/eventing/enabled 1
   ```

### Install the B2B extension

For B2B merchants, install the following extension to include [requisition list](events.md#b2b-events) event data.

Download the `magento/experience-platform-connector-b2b` extension by running the following from the command line:

   ```bash
   composer require magento/experience-platform-connector-b2b
   ```

## Update the [!DNL Data Connection] extension {#update}

To update the [!DNL Data Connection] extension, run the following from the command line:

```bash
composer update magento/experience-platform-connector --with-dependencies
```

Or, for B2B merchants:

```bash
composer update magento/experience-platform-connector-b2b --with-dependencies
```

To update to a major version such as from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0, edit the project's root [!DNL Composer] `.json` file as follows:

1. Open the root `composer.json` file and search for `magento/experience-platform-connector`.

1. In the `require` section, update the version number as follows:

   ```json
   "require": {
      ...
      "magento/experience-platform-connector": "^3.0",
      ...
    }
   ```

1. **Save** `composer.json`. Then, run the following from the command line:

   ```bash
   composer update magento/experience-platform-connector â€“-with-dependencies
   ```

   Or, for B2B merchants:

   ```bash
   composer update magento/experience-platform-connector-b2b --with-dependencies
   ```
