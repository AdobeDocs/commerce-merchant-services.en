## Connect to services

The [Commerce Services Connector](saas.md) provides the integration for your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source instance using an API key and a private key. For data services (Adobe Commerce only), you can also specify the data space in the configuration.

## Catalog synching

For services that use catalog data (Product Recommendations and Live Search), the [Catalog Sync](catalog-sync.md) process exports product data from the Commerce server to Commerce Services on an ongoing basis to keep the services up to date.
