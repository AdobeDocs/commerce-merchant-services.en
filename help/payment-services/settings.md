## Configure roles

To ensure that Admin users can create and manage orders in the Commerce Admin, enable [!DNL Payment Services]-specific resources to user roles.

See [User roles](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/systems/user-accounts/permissions-user-roles.html) to learn how to manage roles.

When assigning resources to the role, you must select:

- **Pay with [!DNL Payment Services]**---This resource ensures that when you create an order in the Admin, [!DNL Payment Services] credit cards are available as a payment method. If you select the **Actions** parent resource, this resource will also be selected.
- **[!DNL Payment Services]**---This resource includes the **Dashboard** and **SaaS Services Proxy** resources, which must also be selected. They ensure that [!DNL Payment Services] appears in the _Sales_ menu.

   ![Payment Services resources](assets/roles-payments.png)

## Flush the cache

 If you change the configuration in _Settings_, for example toggling the Apple Pay, Venmo, or PayPal PayLater buttons, manually flush the cache so that your store shows the latest configurations.

 1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Cache Management]**.
 1. Click **[!UICONTROL Flush Cache]** to refresh all invalid caches.

If any Cache Type in the Cache Management table has an `INVALIDATED` status, your store might not show the most recent configuration for that item. Flush the cache to update your store to show the latest configuration.

To ensure that your store is showing the correct configuration, periodically [flush the cache](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/system/cache-management.html).

## Card vaulting

You can enable functionality that allows your customers to vault---or "save"---their credit card information in their My Account to use for future purchases.

You can also use card vaulting in the Admin to complete subsequent orders for existing customers.

Enable or disable card vaulting in the [Credit card field settings](#credit-card-fields).

See [Credit card vaulting](vaulting.md) for more information.

## 3DS

3DS protects customers and merchants from fraudulent activity in their stores, and enables compliance with European Union (EU) standards.

Enable or disable 3DS in the [Credit card field settings](#credit-card-fields).

See [3DS in Security](security.md#3ds) for more information.

## Use multiple PayPal accounts

In [!UICONTROL Payment Services], you can use multiple PayPal accounts within **one** merchant account on the website level. For instance, if you are operating your store(s) in multiple countries (which use different [currencies](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/currency.html)) or want to use Adobe Commerce for some parts of your business but not _all_, you can set up your merchant account to use multiple PayPal accounts.

See [Site, Store, and View Scope](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/setup/websites-stores-views.html) for more information about the hierarchy of websites, stores, and store views.

Your Sales representative can create a new [scope](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/setup/websites-stores-views.html#scope-settings) for your merchant account and onboard the additional site with PayPal so that any of the PayPal buttons you configure to appear will show on your site. Contact your Sales representative for assistance with using multiple PayPal accounts for your websites.
