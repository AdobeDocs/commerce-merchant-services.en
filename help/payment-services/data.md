# Available Data

Some order and payouts data is available to you so that you can coordinate Adobe Commerce financial reporting across external systems.

## Reconcile with ERP system

You can reconcile Adobe Commerce financial reporting with your non-Adobe Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system using the increment ID associated with a specific order.

When Payment Services sends the Commerce order to PayPal, the increment ID is included as the `custom_id` _and_ in the `invoice_id` (which also contains a random string after the `increment_id`).

The IDs are easily accessible in both the merchant activity detail for a payout and in the PayPal webhook.

The `invoice_id` and `custom_id` are displayed near the bottom of the merchant activity detail for a payout:

![`custom_id` in merchant activity detail](assets/merchant-activity-ids.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

`custom_id` and `invoice_id` in the details in PayPal's webhook:
