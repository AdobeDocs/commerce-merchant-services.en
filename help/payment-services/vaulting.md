# Credit card vaulting

Convert one-time customers into loyal shoppers with credit card vaulting. Shoppers can save---or "vault"---their credit card credentials during checkout to use in a later purchase for the same, or another, store within the same merchant account.

Shoppers use the stored token to complete a future checkout with their saved credit card information.

They can also easily delete their vaulted credit cards from [Stored Payment Methods](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/customers/account-dashboard-stored-payment-methods.html) in their My Account.

## Enable vaulting

You can enable credit card vaulting for your stores in Payment Services [Settings](settings.md#card-vaulting).

## Security

Minimal credit card information is shared with the shopper; they only see the last four digits, expiration date, and brand of their vaulted credit card. Credit card information is stored with the payment provider to satisfy [PCI](security.md#PCI-compliance) compliance standards.
