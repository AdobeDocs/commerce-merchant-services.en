## Troubleshooting

You may see errors when attempting to install the [!DNL Payment Services] extension. Use the following troubleshooting methods to resolve the errors.

### Incorrect Composer keys

If you see the following error denoting that you have the incorrect Composer keys:

```terminal
Could not find a matching version of package magento/payment-services. Check the package spelling, your version constraint and that the package is available in a stability which matches your minimum-stability (stable).
```

Verify that your Composer keys are valid and you have access to other Magento packages.

To see which Composer keys are configured:

1. Find the location of the `auth.json` file:

   ```bash
   composer config --global home
   ```

1. View the `auth.json` file:

   ```bash
   cat /path/to/auth.json
   ```

1. See [which keys are associated with your Commerce account `MageID`](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html).

### Not enough memory for PHP

If you see the following error denoting you do not have enough memory for PHP:

```terminal
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 2146435072 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 4096 bytes) in phar:///usr/local/bin/composer/src/Composer/DependencyResolver/RuleWatchGraph.php on line 52
```

[Increase the memory limit](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/magento-app-php-ini.html#increase-php-memory-limit) for PHP on your environment in `php.ini`.

Alternatively, you can specify the memory limit using this command: `php -d memory_limit=-1 [path to composer]/composer require magento/payment-services`.

For example:

```bash
php -d memory_limit=-1 vendor/bin/composer require magento/payment-services
```
