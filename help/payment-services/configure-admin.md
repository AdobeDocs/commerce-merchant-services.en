# Legacy [!DNL Payment Services] Configuration

You can customize [!DNL Payment Services] to your needs with helpful configuration options in the Admin.

When you configure [!DNL Payment Services] for [!DNL Adobe Commerce] and [!DNL Magento Open Source] in the Admin, those configurations apply only to the environment that is set in the _[!UICONTROL Method]_ field of _[!UICONTROL General Configuration]_. Any changes you make in the configuration fields are independent of switching the _[!UICONTROL Method]_ selection---if you switch the method, your selections do not reset.

## General configuration

You can enable [!DNL Payment Services] for your store and your  _[!UICONTROL Merchant Location]_, and enable either sandbox testing or live payments in the _[!UICONTROL General Configuration]_ section.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.
1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Sales]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Payment Methods]**.
1. Set the _[!UICONTROL Merchant Country]_ field in the _[!UICONTROL Merchant Location]_. If a _[!UICONTROL Merchant Country]_ is not specified, the _[!UICONTROL Default Country]_ from the general configuration is used.
1. Expand the _[!UICONTROL FEATURED ADOBE PAYMENT SOLUTION]_ section to access the _[!UICONTROL [!DNL Payment Services]]_ section.
1. In the _[!UICONTROL [!DNL Payment Services]]_ section, expand the _[!UICONTROL General Configuration]_ section.
1. For **Enable**, set it to `Yes` to enable [!DNL Payment Services] for your store.
1. For **Method**, set it to `Sandbox` if you are still testing [!DNL Payment Services] for your store or `Production` if you are ready to enable live payments.
1. Your **[!UICONTROL Payment Services Sandbox ID]** and **[!UICONTROL Payment Services Production ID]** values are automatically populated once you setup the [Commerce Services Connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas){target=_blank} and visit the [!DNL Payment Services] dashboard for the first time. Do this to finish the onboarding for your sandbox and/or production environments. These values associate your SaaS ID to [!DNL Payment Services].

    >[!WARNING]
    >
    > If you need to change your dataspace ID in the Commerce Services Connector, you need to reset your [!DNL Payment Services] ID. Click **Reset Payment Services ID** to reset your Sandbox or Production IDs. If you reset your [!DNL Payment Services] IDs, you must onboard again.

1. For **Soft Descriptor** (custom values which show on customer transaction bank statements to delineate between stores/brands/catalogs), add your custom text (up to 22 characters) in the text field, replacing `Soft descriptor` or the existing value.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]** to save your changes.
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Cache Management]**, and then click **[!UICONTROL Flush Cache]** to refresh all invalid caches.
