# Command Line Configuration

After you install [!DNL Payment Services], you can easily configure it from [within the home](payments-home.md) or via the Command-line Interface (CLI).

## Configure data export

[!DNL Payment Services] combines order data exported from [!DNL Magento Open Source] and [!DNL Adobe Commerce] with aggregated payment data from payment providers to create useful reports. The [!DNL Payment Services] extension uses indexers to efficiently collect all necessary data for the reports.

To learn about the data used in [!DNL Payment Services] reporting, See [Order payment status report](order-payment-status.md#data-used-in-the-report).

### Configure cron on [!DNL Magento Open Source]

If you want to use a `BY SCHEDULE` index mode on [!DNL Magento Open Source], you must configure cron. See [Configure and run cron](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html).

### Set indexers

Order data is exported and persisted in the Payment Service, using one of two index modes---`ON SAVE` (default) or `BY SCHEDULE` (recommended).

The following indexes are for [!DNL Payment Services]:

|   Code    |   Name    |   Description    |
|    ---    |  ---  |  ---  |
|   `sales_order_data_exporter`    |   Sales Order Feed   |   Builds index of order data  |
|   `sales_order_status_data_exporter`    |   Sales Order Statuses Feed    |    Builds index of sales order statuses data   |
|   `store_data_exporter`    |   Stores Feed    |   Builds index of store data   |

To change the index mode for all three indexers, run:

``` bash
bin/magento indexer:set-mode schedule sales_order_data_exporter sales_order_status_data_exporter store_data_exporter
```

>[!TIP]
>
>If you don't specify any indexers in your command, all indexers are updated to the same value. If you want to change a specific indexer, you must list it in your command.

To learn more about manually changing the mode of an indexer, see [Configure indexers](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-index.html#configure-indexers){target="_blank"} in the developer documentation. To learn how to change it in the Admin, see [Index management](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/system/index-management.html#change-the-index-mode){target="_blank"} in the core user guide.

### Manually reindex data

You can manually reindex data, instead of waiting for it to happen automatically. See [Reindex](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-index.html#reindex){target="_blank"} in [Manage the Indexers](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-index.html){target="_blank"} for more information.

When `BY SCHEDULE` mode is set, the system tracks changed entities and the cron job updates the index for them based on a set schedule. See [Run cron from the command line](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html#config-cli-cron-group-run) in [Configure and run cron](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html)) to learn how to manually trigger indexation using cron jobs.

### Send reindexed data to payment service

After the data is indexed, it will be sent automatically to [!DNL Payment Services]. You can also manually trigger the process of sending indexed data with this command:

``` bash
bin/magento saas:resync --feed [feedName]
```

Use the following command options:

|   Command    |   Description    |
|  ---  |  ---  |
|   `bin/magento saas:resync --feed [feedName]`    |   Performs a reindexation of the specified feed and sends it to the corresponding service   |
|   `bin/magento saas:resync --no-reindex`    |    Skips indexation and sends unsynced data from the indexes  |

The `--feed` parameter allows you to specify which feed you want to send:

|   Feed    |   Description    |
|  ---  |  ---  |
|    `paymentServicesOrdersProduction`   |   Orders feed in Production mode    |
|    `paymentServicesOrdersSandbox`    |   Orders feed in Sandbox mode    |
|    `paymentServicesOrderStatusesProduction`   |   Order statuses in Production mode    |
|    `paymentServicesOrderStatusesSandbox`   |   Order statuses in Sandbox mode    |
|    `paymentServicesStoresProduction`   |    Stores in Production mode   |
|    `paymentServicesStoresSandbox`  |   Stores in Sandbox mode    |

All data needed for the reports is sent to [!DNL Payment Services] automatically if cron is configured and installed. You can also manually trigger the process of sending cron data to [!DNL Payment Services].

``` bash
bin/magento cron:run --group payment_services_data_export
```

To learn more about reindexing and indexers, see the [Manage the indexers](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-index.html) topic in the developer documentation.

## Configure L2/L3 processing
