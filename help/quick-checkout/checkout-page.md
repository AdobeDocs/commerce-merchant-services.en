# Checkout Page in Adobe Commerce

The checkout page is where customers enter the required information to place an order.

An example of a checkout page:

![Checkout page](assets/checkout-page.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

For more information on the Adobe Commerce standard checkout page, refer to the [checkout page](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/quick-tour/checkout-page.html) topic.

Out-of-the-box, the checkout consists of two steps:

>[!NOTE]
>
> If after entering an email address at the checkout page the customer is recognized as previously registered, the sign-in prompt will be displayed only if the Stores > Configuration > Sales > Checkout > Enable Guest Checkout Login field in the Admin is set to Yes. However, doing this can expose customer information to unauthenticated users.


- Shipping Information
- Review and Payment Information

>[!NOTE]
>
> After the first step is completed, checkout displays the checkout totals and the corresponding side-bar information.

Refer to the [checkout flow](../quick-checkout/checkout-flow.md) topic for more information on the [!DNL Quick Checkout] flow.
