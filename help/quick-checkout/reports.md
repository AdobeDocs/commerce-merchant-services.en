# Reports

[!DNL Quick Checkout] for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source offers you comprehensive reporting so that you can get detailed information of your store's checkout experience statistics.

>[!WARNING]
>
> You must enable [**Checkout tracking**](../quick-checkout/settings-quick-checkout.md) in your Admin panel so Adobe Commerce is allowed to share checkout information with Bolt. By default this configuration option is set to **Yes**. If this option is disabled (set to **No**), reporting will be affected.

## Overview reports
