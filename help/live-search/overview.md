# Introduction to [!DNL Live Search]

[!DNL Live Search] is a set of standalone packages for Adobe Commerce that replaces the standard search capabilities. The [!DNL Live Search] module is installed from the command line of the server and connects to your Commerce installation as a [service](../landing/saas.md). When the process is complete, [!DNL Live Search] appears on the *Marketing* menu under *SEO & Search* in the [!DNL Commerce] *Admin*.

The Adobe Commerce side of the architecture includes hosting the search *Admin*, synchronizing catalog data, and running the query service. After [!DNL Live Search] is installed and configured, Adobe Commerce begins sharing search and catalog data with SaaS services. At this point, Admin users can set up, customize, and manage search facets, synonyms, and merchandising rules.
