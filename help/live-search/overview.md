# [!DNL Live Search]

[!DNL Live Search] is a set of standalone packages that replaces standard Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce search capabilities. The [!DNL Live Search] module is installed from the command line of the server and connects to your Adobe Commerce installation as a [service](../landing/saas.md). When the process is complete, [!DNL Live Search] appears on the *Marketing* menu under *SEO & Search* in the [!DNL Commerce] *Admin*.

The Adobe Commerce side of the architecture includes hosting the search *Admin*, syncing catalog data, and running the query service.
