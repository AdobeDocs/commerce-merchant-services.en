## Set the scope

Initially the [scope](stores/websites-stores-views.html) of all [!DNL Live Search] settings is set to `Default Store View`. If your [!DNL Commerce] installation includes multiple store views, set **Scope** to the [store view](configuration/scope.html) where your facet settings apply.

## Menu Options

| Option | Description |
|--- |--- |
| [Performance](performance.html) | Dashboard provides insight into product search performance. | 
| [Faceting](facets.html) | High-performance filtering that uses multiple dimensions of attribute values to refine search criteria. |
| [Synonyms](synonyms.html) | Extend the reach of search to include words shoppers might use to find products that differ from those in your catalog. |
| [Rules](rules.html) | Shape the search experience with logical rules that trigger scheduled actions. Boost, bury, pin, or hide products to calibrate search results to support your business goals. |
| [GraphQL](https://devdocs.magento.com/live-search/graphql-support.html) | Developers who are logged into the Admin of your store can compose and test queries with actual catalog data. To learn more, go to [GraphQL Overview](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/index.html) in the [!DNL Live Search] developer documentation. |
| [Feedback]feedback.html) | Send your feedback directly to the [!DNL Live Search] team. |
