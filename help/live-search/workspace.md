# Workspace

The workspace is where you configure, manage, and monitor the performance of [!DNL Live Search]. The menu across the top provides access to the tools in each functional area.  The available features reflect the current menu selection.

## Set the scope

Initially the [scope](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/scope.html) of all [!DNL Live Search] settings is set to `Default Store View`. If your [!DNL Commerce] installation includes multiple store views, set **Scope** to the [store view](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/websites-stores-views.html) where your facet settings apply.

## Menu Options
