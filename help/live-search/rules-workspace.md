The rules workspace lists the current selection of rules and their status, and provides access to tools you need to create and manage rules. From the workspace you can:

* Search for rules
* View rule details
* Activate/deactivate rules
* Delete rules

## Show/hide columns

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Show/hide** ![Column selector](assets/btn-show-hide-columns.png) columns.
   The visible columns have a blue check mark in the options menu. The rule name is the only column that cannot be hidden.

## Filter rules by status

1. If your store has many rules, you can filter the rules by status to shorten the list. By default, the Rules list displays all rules.

1. To list only rules with a specific status setting, set **Status** to one of the following:

   * All
   * Active
   * Inactive
   * Scheduled

## Search rules by name

Begin typing the name of the rule, or any word in the rule name.
Search finds the matching rule(s) as you type. The string of matching characters are highlighted in the name of each rule found.
