## Filtered search with facets

## Synonyms

[Synonyms](synonyms.html) expand the reach and sharpen the focus of queries by including words shoppers might use that differ from those in the catalog. You can fine tune the synonym dictionary to keep shoppers engaged and on the path to purchase.

## Merchandising rules

Merchandising [rules](rules.html) shape the shopping experience with if-then statements that add logic and events to search. You can easily boost or bury products for a promotion, season, or other period of time.
