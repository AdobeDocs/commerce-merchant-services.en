# Storefront Widgets

When you install [!DNL Live Search] you get two new widgets on your storefront:

- [!DNL Live Search] [popover widget](storefront-popover.md) is the box that opens under the search field that contains the search results.
- [Product Listing Page widget](plp-styling.md) (PLP) provides a searchable product listing page with facets and synonym support. The widget is installed and enabled in Live Search 4.0.0+.

You can customize the look and feel of these widgets to best match your company's style and branding guidelines.

## Live Search popover widget

When you begin to type in the Commerce storefront search box, [!DNL Live Search] responds with suggested products and a thumbnail image of top search results in the [popover widget](storefront-popover.md).

## Product listing page widget

When you click to see all results from the storefront popover, the product listing page widget displays features you can use to continually refine your search.
