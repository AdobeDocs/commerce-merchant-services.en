# Rules

[!DNL Live Search] rules combine logic with actions to shape a shopper's search experience in your store. You can use rules to boost, bury, pin or hide products to calibrate search results in real time to support your business goals.

Each rule has three main components:

* Conditions – The condition(s) that trigger an action.
* Events – The action(s) that take place when the condition(s) are met.
* Details – The name of the rule, and optional time frame and description.

You can combine multiple conditions and actions, and schedule a rule to be active for a specific period of time.
