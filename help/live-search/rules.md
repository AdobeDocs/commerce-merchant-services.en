# Rules

[!DNL Live Search] rules combine logic with actions to shape a shopper's search experience in your store. You can use rules to boost, bury, pin, or hide products to calibrate search results in real time to support your business goals.

Each rule has three main components:

* Conditions – The conditions that trigger an action.
* Events – The actions that take place when the conditions are met.
* Details – The name of the rule, and optional time frame and description.

You can combine multiple conditions and actions, and schedule a rule to be active for a period.
