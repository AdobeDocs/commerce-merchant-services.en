Adobe provides a collection of hosted services to help merchants support key components of their business. 

## Connect to services

The [Commerce Services Connector](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/system/saas.html) provides the integration for your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source instance using an API key and a private key. For data services (Adobe Commerce only), you can also specify the data space in the configuration. You only need to set this up once.
