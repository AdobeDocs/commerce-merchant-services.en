## Configure Logging

Logs for store fulfillment services are available in the log file `var/log/walmart-bopis.log`.

Ask the system administrator to configure your environments to allow exception handling so that API-related exceptions can be captured through the firewall or cache.

Because the application log file can grow quickly, enable logging for the application only for a short time when neededâ€“for example when troubleshooting store fulfillment issues for a [!DNL Commerce] order. This configuration prevents response time issues in production environments caused by large log files.

>[!TIP]
>
>For Adobe Commerce on-premises installations, ask your system administrator to set up log rotation for the `var/log/walmart-bopis.log` file to minimize the size. For Adobe Commerce on-premises installations, see [Log rotation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/next-steps/configuration.html?lang=en#server-settings) in the _Adobe Commerce Installation Guide_. For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects, see [View and manage logs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/develop/test/log-locations.html).

## Delivery Methods 

Store Fulfillment works by extending the native Adobe Commerce [!DNL In-Store Delivery] capabilities. After you install the extension, you can configure in-store delivery methods using the following extended settings that are added to the Admin.

- **In-store pick up**â€”Offer options for in-store delivery during the checkout process
This is the most common delivery scenario for BOPIS orders.

- **[!UICONTROL Curbside pick up]**â€“Offer options for customers to park at a store location and have their order delivered to them by a store associate.

Configure these settings from the Admin by selecting <strong>[!UICONTROL Stores > Configuration > Sales > Delivery Methods > In-Store Pickup]</strong>.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For additional information about configuring in-store delivery options, see [In-Store Delivery](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/shipping/shipping-in-store-delivery.html) in the _Adobe Commerce User Guide_.
