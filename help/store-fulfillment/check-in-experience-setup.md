# Check-In Experience setup

The Store pickup workflow for the Store Fulfillment solution includes a Pickup Order form that customers complete during the shopping experience. This form can be customized to require car description inputs.

Including car description information in a customer check-in request helps store associates deliver curbside pickup orders quickly and accurately.
