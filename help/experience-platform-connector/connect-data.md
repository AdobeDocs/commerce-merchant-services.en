# Connect Commerce data to Adobe Experience Platform {#connectaep}

To connect your Adobe Commerce instance to the Adobe Experience Platform, you must provide an organization ID and a datastream ID.

![Experience Platform connector configuration](assets/epc-config.png)

1. Sign in to your Adobe account in the [Commerce Services Connector](../landing/saas.md#organizationid) and select your organization ID.

1. In the Admin, go to **System** > Services > **Experience Platform Connector**.

1. In the **Scope** drop-down, set the context to **Website**.

1. In the **Organization ID** field, you see the ID associated with your Adobe Experience Platform account, as configured in the [Commerce Services Connector](../landing/saas.md#organizationid). The organization ID is global. Only one organization ID can be associated per Adobe Commerce instance.

1. [Create](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/configure.html#create) a new datastream in the Adobe Experience Platform or select an existing datastream you want to use for collection.

1. In the **Datastream ID** field, paste the ID of that new or existing datastream.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The scope of the datastream ID must be set at the website level or higher. At that level, the same datastream ID is used for each website in the hierarchy. You cannot set the datastream ID scope at the storeview level.

1. (Optional) If you do not have an Experience Platform Web SDK deployed to your site, leave this field blank and the Experience Platform connector deploys one for you. Otherwise, add the name of your Experience Platform Web SDK.

## Field descriptions

| Field | Description |
|--- |--- |
| Scope | Specific website where you want the configuration settings to apply. |
| Organization ID (Global)| ID that belongs to the organization that purchased the Adobe DX product. This ID links your Adobe Commerce instance to Adobe Experience Platform. |
| Datastream ID (Website) | ID that allows data to flow from Adobe Experience Platform to other Adobe DX products. This ID must be associated to a specific website within your specific Adobe Commerce instance. |
|AEP Web SDK Name (Global)| If you do not have an Experience Platform Web SDK deployed to your site, leave this field blank and the Experience Platform connector deploys one for you. If you already have an Experience Platform Web SDK deployed to your site, specify the name of that SDK in this field. This allows the Storefront Event Collector and Storefront Event SDK to use your Experience Platform Web SDK rather than the version deployed by the Experience Platform connector.|

With the Experience Platform connector extension installed, the link between Adobe Commerce and Adobe Experience Platform created, and the Datastream ID specified, Commerce data begins to flow to the Adobe Experience Platform edge and to other Adobe DX products. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> The amount of time it takes for data to flow from the edge to other Adobe DX products can vary.

## Commerce data at the edge

When Commerce data is sent to the Adobe Experience Platform edge, you can build reports like the following:

1. (Beta) For merchants in the beta program, there is an extra datastream field called [!UICONTROL Datastream ID For Server Side Events (Website)]. In this field, specify the datastream ID you [created](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/overview.html#create) for server-side events.

    The first datastream ID includes data related to shopper interactions on the storefront, such as `productPageView`, `addToCart`, and so on. The data includes a primary identifier or ECID, which represents the device the shopper is using. Regardless if a shopper is logged in or shopping anonymously, the ECID is always present in the event payload. The second datastream ID is for order status events, which are generated by the Adobe Commerce system and not by shopper interactions on the storefront. When a shopper places an order, they are required to specify an email address. As the ECID is the primary identifier for storefront events, an email address is the primary identifier for order status events. All updates to the order after this point are represented in a different schema and with `emailAddress` as the primary identifier. By requiring two separate datastream IDs, you can identify which events are generated by the storefront and which events are generated by the Adobe Commerce system.

1. (Optional) If you do not have an Experience Platform Web SDK deployed to your site, leave this field blank and the Experience Platform connector deploys one for you. Otherwise, add the name of your Experience Platform Web SDK.

This page documents the setup needed to stream server side Order events into AEP.
Profile stitching
In order to stitch server side events with a profile, there needs to a profile with email as an identity present on AEP. If a profile is not present, events will not be linked.
Setup steps
Create the server side schema
Add identityMap. This needs to be added even if the default schema has it
Do not set a primary key.
Enable the schema for profile
Select the following check box
Add the following field groups
commerce
Personal contact Details
identityMap
productListItems
Create a Dataset 
Create Datastream
Add the schema and add the service 'Adobe Experience Platform' on the Datastream
Select the dataset 
Set the Datastream as 'serverDatastream' on admin console under 'Experience Platform connector'
Note that this feature is in development and will be available after the moratorium in 2023. Until then, we will manually load the datastream using GRPC calls
Server-side events are generated and sent to AEP when the following actions occur:
- Create Order (eventType: `orderPlaced`)
- Cancel Order (eventType: `orderCancelled`)
- Ship order line item (eventType: `orderLineItemShipped`)
- Line Item Returned (eventType: `orderLineItemReturned`)
See [server-side events](events.md#serverside) for details about the data collected for these events.
