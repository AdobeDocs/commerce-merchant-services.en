# Connect Commerce data to Adobe Experience Platform

When you install the Experience Platform connector, two new configuration pages appear in the **System** menu under **Services** in the Commerce _Admin_.

- Commerce Services Connector
- Experience Platform Connector

To connect your Adobe Commerce instance to the Adobe Experience Platform, you must configure both connectors, starting with the Commerce Services connector then finishing with the Experience Platform connector.

## Update the Commerce Services connector

If you have previously installed an Adobe Commerce service, you probably have already configured the Commerce Services connector. If not, then you must complete the following tasks on the [Commerce Services connector](../landing/saas.md) page:

1. Log in to your Commerce account to [retrieve your production and sandbox API keys](../landing/saas.md#credentials).
1. Select a [SaaS data space](../landing/saas.md#saas-configuration).
1. Log in to your Adobe account to [retrieve your Organization ID](../landing/saas.md#ims-organization-optional).

After you configure the Commerce Services connector, you then configure the Experience Platform connector.

## Update the Experience Platform connector

In this section, you connect your Adobe Commerce instance to the Adobe Experience Platform using your organization ID. You can then specify the type of data - storefront and back office - to send to the Experience Platform edge.

## General

1. Sign in to your Adobe account in the [Commerce Services Connector](../landing/saas.md#organizationid) and select your organization ID.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If you previously configured the Commerce Services connector, you can skip this step as your organization ID has already been selected.

1. In the Admin, go to **System** > Services > **Experience Platform Connector**.

1. In the **Scope** drop-down, set the context to **Website**.

1. In the **Organization ID** field, verify the ID associated with your Adobe Experience Platform account, as configured in the [Commerce Services Connector](../landing/saas.md#organizationid). The organization ID is global. Only one organization ID can be associated per Adobe Commerce instance.

1. (Optional) If you already have an [AEP Web SDK (alloy)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html) deployed to your site, enable the checkbox and add the name of your AEP Web SDK. Otherwise, leave these fields blank and the Experience Platform connector deploys one for you.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If you specify your own AEP Web SDK, the Experience Platform connector uses the datastream ID associated with that SDK and not the datastream ID specified on this page (if any).

## Data collection

In this section, you specify the type of data you want to send to the Experience Platform edge. There are two types of data: client-side and server-side.

Client-side data is data captured on the storefront. This includes shopper interactions, such as `View Page`, `View Product`,Â `Add to Cart`, and [requisition list](events.md#b2b-events) information (for B2B merchants). Server-side data, or back office data, is data captured in the Commerce servers. This includes information about the status of an order, such as if an order was placed, canceled, refunded, shipped, or completed. 

To ensure that your Adobe Commerce instance can begin data collection, review the [prerequisites](overview.md#prerequisites).

See the events topic to learn more about [storefront](events.md#storefront-events) and [back office](events.md#back-office-events) events.

>[!NOTE]
>
>All fields in the **Data collection** section apply to the **Website** scope or higher.

1. Select **Storefront events** if you want to send storefront behavioral data.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The **Storefront events** checkbox is automatically enabled if the AEP Web SDK and Organization ID are valid.

1. Select **Back office events** if you want to send order status information, such as if an order was placed, canceled, refunded, or shipped.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If you select **Back office events**, all back office data is sent to the Experience Platform edge. If a shopper chooses to opt out of data collection, you must explicitly set the shopper's privacy preference in the Experience Platform. This is different from storefront events where the collector already handles consent based on shopper preferences. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/governance-privacy-security/consent/adobe/dataset.html) about setting a shopper's privacy preference in the Experience Platform.

1. To ensure back office event data updates based on a schedule according to a [cron](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/systems/tools/cron.html) job, you must change the `Sales Orders Feed` index to `Update by Schedule`.

    1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > _[!UICONTROL Tools]_ > **[!UICONTROL Index Management]**.

    1. Select the checkbox for the `Sales Orders Feed` indexer.

    1. Set **[!UICONTROL Actions]** to `Update by Schedule`.

    1. If you are enabling back office data for the first time, run the following commands to reindex and trigger a resync. Subsequent resyncs occur automatically as long as the [cron](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/systems/tools/cron.html) job is set up correctly.

        ```bash
        bin/magento index:reindex sales_order_data_exporter_v2
        ```

        ```bash
        bin/magento saas:resync --feed orders
        ```

1. (Skip this step if you are using your own AEP Web SDK.) [Create](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/configure.html#create) a datastream in the Adobe Experience Platform or select an existing datastream you want to use for collection.

1. (Skip this step if you are using your own AEP Web SDK.) In the **Datastream ID** field, paste the ID of that new or existing datastream.

## Field descriptions

| Field | Description |
|--- |--- |
| Scope | Specific website where you want the configuration settings to apply. |
| Organization ID (Global)| ID that belongs to the organization that purchased the Adobe DX product. This ID links your Adobe Commerce instance to Adobe Experience Platform. |
|Is the AEP Web SDK already deployed to your site|Select this checkbox if you have deployed your own AEP Web SDK to your site|
|AEP Web SDK Name (Global)| If you already have an Experience Platform Web SDK deployed to your site, specify the name of that SDK in this field. This allows the Storefront Event Collector and Storefront Event SDK to use your Experience Platform Web SDK rather than the version deployed by the Experience Platform connector. If you do not have an Experience Platform Web SDK deployed to your site, leave this field blank and the Experience Platform connector deploys one for you.|
|Storefront events|Is checked by default as long as the Organization ID and datastream ID are valid. Storefront events collect anonymized behavioral data from your shoppers as they browse your site.|
|Back Office events| If checked, event payload contains anonymized order status information, such as if an order was placed, canceled, refunded, or shipped. |
| Datastream ID (Website) | ID that allows data to flow from Adobe Experience Platform to other Adobe DX products. This ID must be associated to a specific website within your specific Adobe Commerce instance. If you specify your own Experience Platform Web SDK, do not specify a datastream ID in this field. The Experience Platform connector uses the datastream ID associated with that SDK and ignores any datastream ID specified in this field (if any).|

>[!NOTE]
>
>After onboarding, storefront data begins to flow to the Experience Platform edge. Back office data takes about five minutes to appear at the edge. Subsequent updates are visible at the edge based on the cron schedule.

## (Beta) Send historical order data

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available for beta users only. You can join the beta by sending an email to the following address: [dataconnection@adobe.com](mailto:dataconnection@adobe.com).

Adobe Commerce collects up to five years of historical order data and status. You can use the Experience Platform connector to send that historical data to the Experience Platform to enrich your customer profiles based on those past orders. The data is stored in a dataset within Experience Platform.

While Commerce already collects the historical order data, you need to install and configure your Commerce instance so that data can be sent to Experience Platform.

### Install historical order beta

To enable historical order data collection, you need to install the following from the command line:

```bash
magento/experience-platform-connector: "^3.0.0-beta1"
```

for B2B merchants, run the following command:

```bash
they don't run this command but rather update their composer file
magento/experience-platform-connector-b2b: "^2.0.0-beta1"
```

### Configure historical order beta

To ensure your customers order history can be sent to Experience Platform, you must specify credentials that link your Commerce instance to Experience Platform.

Note if you have already installed and enabled the Audience Activation module, you already specified the credentials needed and you can skip this step. If you have not already installed and enabled the Audience Activation module, complete the following steps:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. Expand **[!UICONTROL Services]** and select **[!UICONTROL Experience Platform Connector]**. 

1. Enter the configuration credentials found in the [developer console](https://developer.adobe.com/console/home).

    ![Experience Platform Connector Admin Configuration](./assets/rtcdp-admin-config.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

1. Click **Save Config**.

1. Verify that the following features are enabled in your Commerce instance:

    1. To sync orders, you need to configure the [Message Queue Framework](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/components/message-queues/).
    1. Provision Rabbitmq according to [this guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/service/rabbitmq.html).
    1. Enable message queues consumers by cron job in `.magento.env.yaml` using `CRON_CONSUMERS_RUNNER` environment variable.

       ```yaml
       stage:
         deploy:
           CRON_CONSUMERS_RUNNER:
             cron_run: true
       ```

1. Add the dev console details in configuration
1. Goto EPC --> Order History ->  Add Dataset and date range, date range validation?
1. Dataset creation  on AEP
same as AEP , create schema and then the dataset. Merchant should use the same dataset as the one used in storefront and backoffice events
Document how to get dataset ID in AEP
1. Order Sync setup:

2.4.7 - Rabbit MQ is included by default, but any earlier version should configure Rabbit MQ - https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/rest/bulk-endpoints.html
Consumers will need to enabled

Historical order data is batched data as opposed to storefront and back office data that is streaming data. Batched data takes about 45 minutes to arrive in Experience Platform.

Document historical orders behavior and use cases.
Clarify in the docs that for batch exports, the data takes 45 minutes before it arrives in a data lake. Update this topic and clarify that:

1. Batched data takes longer. 45 minutes to arrive in data lake

Does batch data use same data stream?

1. It doesn't go to the edge but to the data lake. You still can query the dataset to confirm data is being sent.

1. Maybe also discuss difference between streaming data and batch data.

Need to review error strings/success strings
Need to tell users how to view errors in log files

>[!NOTE]
>
>For beta, if you trigger a sync multiple times on the same or overlapping time range, you will see duplicate events in the dataset.


If user does not have audience activation, they will need to configure the EPC in the configuration page of the admin. If they already have audience activation, when they upgrade epc for order history, their previously configured tokens will remain intact and no further configuration is necessary.

## Confirm that event data is collected

To confirm that data is being collected from your Commerce store, use the [Adobe Experience Platform debugger](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/debugger/home.html) to examine your Commerce site. After you confirm that data is being collected, you can verify that your storefront and back office event data appears at the edge by running a query that returns data from the [dataset you created](overview.md#prerequisites).

1. Select **Queries** in the left navigation of Experience Platform and click [!UICONTROL Create Query].
    
    ![Query Editor](assets/query-editor.png)

1. When the Query Editor opens, enter a query that selects data from the dataset.

    ![Create query](assets/create-query.png)

    For example, your query might look like the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT * from `your_dataset_name` ORDER by TIMESTAMP DESC
    ```

1. After the query runs, the results are displayed in the **Results** tab, next to the **Console** tab. This view shows the tabular output of your query.

    ![Query Editor](assets/query-results.png)

In this example, you see event data from the [`commerce.productListAdds`](events.md#addtocart), [`commerce.productViews`](events.md#productpageview), [`web.webpagedetails.pageViews`](events.md#pageview), and so on. This view allows you to verify that your Commerce data arrived at the edge.

If the results are not what you expect, open your dataset and look for any failed batches imports. Learn more about [troubleshooting batch imports](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/ingestion/batch/troubleshooting.html).
