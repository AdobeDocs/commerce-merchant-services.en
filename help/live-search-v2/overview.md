# What is [!DNL Live Search]?

The products on your site are only purchased if they can be found. Many traditional Commerce search experiences:

- Lack dynamic filters to show relevant attriutes
- Require exact jargon
- Lack typo tolerance
- Lack autocomplete
- Do not allow active merchandising so you can sell what you want to sell
- Are slow or lagging

[!DNL Live Search] for Adobe Commerce delivers a fast, relevant, and intuitive search experience at no additional cost. [!DNL Live Search] powered by [Adobe Sensei](https://www.adobe.com/sensei.html) uses artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms to perform a deep analysis of aggregated visitor data. This data, when combined with your Adobe Commerce catalog, results in a relevant and personalized shopping experience.
